# Project 1 - Wordle

Submitted by: Michael Martinez

Wordle is an app directly based on the popular online game.

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] App displays a keyboard on the screen
- [x] When tapping on the keyboard, a letter is shown or deleted (letter selected)
- [x] User can play a basic version of Wordle, with different goal words each time

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Improve and customize the user interface by adding a launchscreen and app icon
- [ ] Run the app on a device rather than in the simulator

The following **additional** features are to be implemented:

- [ ] Add a confirm entry functionality instead of submitting upon last letter in guess
- [ ] Add a pop-up when the user completes the game (for win and for loss)
- [ ] Add ability to restart the game without closing and reopening the app

## Notes

Implementing the closure was troubling as I had to refer to documentation for syntax to complete
exercise 3. It also took me a while to figure out how to use the UIColor object, and it took 
me some trial and error and documentation searching to correctly complete exercise 9.
